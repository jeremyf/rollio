# Rollio

A tool for loading random tables, rolling on those tables, and rendering the output.

## Todo List

- [X] Create schema to define valid JSON document
- [ ] Integrate schema validation for loaded JSON document
- [X] Allow inner-table logic\*
- [X] Create structure for loading tables
- [ ] Create command line tool
- [X] List available tables (with help) (e.g. `rollio roll -h`)
- [ ] Look to parameterization of table rolls
- [X] Roll on tables (e.g. `rollio roll background`)
- [ ] Create structure for SWN batch of tables to roll at once
- [ ] Add ability to roll a dice expression via `rollio roll`
- [X] Add parameter -w to `rollio roll` that allows override

\* - By inner table logic I'm referring to "On a d10 table, when you roll a 9 or 10, roll on this table twice using a d8"

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rollio'
```

And then execute:

```console
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```console
$ gem install rollio
```

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
